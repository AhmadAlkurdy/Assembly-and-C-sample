# Assembly-and-C-sample
The volume of a circular cone with height h and base radius r is 
 given by Ï€r2h/3. Write a console32 or console64 program that starts with REAL4 values for
r and h in the data segment, calculates volume of the corresponding cone, and stores it at coneVol
in the data segment. You will have the answer in ST before saving it at coneVol. Use the 
debugger at that point to check your calculations.
